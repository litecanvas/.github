Lightweight HTML5 canvas engine suitable for small games and animations.

> **litecanvas** is a game engine to enjoy programming: there is no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools... just coding.
You can try our [online playground](https://litecanvas.github.io) or just installing the [basic template](https://github.com/litecanvas/template):

```
npx degit litecanvas/template my-game
cd my-game
npm install
npm start
```

Or just load the engine code from a CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@litecanvas/litecanvas/dist/dist.js`

### Features

-   **Tiny**: only `4KB` gzipped.
-   **Simple API**: just few functions to draw shapes and some utilities to other things like sounds and math.
-   **Offline-first**: You can install the [playground webapp](https://litecanvas.js.org/) and use anywhere at any time.
-   **Predefined color palette**: just use a number (from 0 to 15) to choose a color.
-   **Predefined sounds**: 16 picked sounds created with [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/).
