# litecanvas

Lightweight HTML5 canvas engine suitable for small games and animations.

> **litecanvas** is a game engine to enjoy programming: there is no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools... just coding.

You can [try our online playground](https://litecanvas.github.io) or install via NPM:

```
npm install @litecanvas/litecanvas
```

Or just load from a CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@litecanvas/litecanvas/dist/dist.js`

### Features

-   **Tiny**: only `4KB` gzipped.
-   **Simple API**: just few functions to draw shapes and some utilities to other things like sounds and math.
-   **Offline-first**: You can install the [playground webapp](https://litecanvas.js.org/) and use anywhere at any time.
-   **Predefined color palette**: just use a number (from 0 to 15) to choose a color.
