Lightweight HTML5 canvas engine suitable for small games and animations.

**litecanvas** is a game engine to enjoy programming: there is no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools... just coding.

You can try our [online playground](https://litecanvas.github.io) or just installing the [basic template](https://github.com/litecanvas/template):

```
npx degit litecanvas/template my-game
cd my-game
npm install
npm start
```

Or just load the engine code from a CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@litecanvas/litecanvas/dist/dist.js`
